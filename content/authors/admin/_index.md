My passion lies in applying mathematics to real-world multidisciplinary challenges and seeking practical solutions that involve different areas of knowledge. I also enjoy working on pure mathematical problems due to their intrinsic beauty. Currently, I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Davis, where I focus on wastewater-based epidemiological modeling, data science, and Bayesian inference. I also enjoy mentoring students.
