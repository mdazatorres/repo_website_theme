title: Methods for Imbalanced Data 
summary: Machine learning problems often involve data with imbalanced class distributions, which means there are far fewer instances of one class than the other. In situations where misclassifying rare events is costly, logistic regression is a popular choice for binary classification. However, this model tends to underperform when dealing with highly imbalanced class distributions
